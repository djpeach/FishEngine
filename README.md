# Input

We are going to start accepting some user input

## Keyboard

We create a class that implements KeyListener, and we create a typical array of boolean for keys, as well as some special members for up down left right.
We then update this on every update and then can use the values to manipulate the objects on the canvas as well as the canvas itself in our game logic.

Be sure to add a listener to our canvas.
